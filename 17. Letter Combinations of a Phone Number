This question is very tricky in Python.

class Solution(object):
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        """
        :type digits: str
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        keyboard = {
                    "2": "abc",
                    "3": "def",
                    "4": "ghi",

        if len(digits) == 0:
            return []

        ans = ['']

        for char in digits:
            ans = [x+y for x in ans for y in keyboard[char]]

        return ans
