We can iterate the char over the strings. If one char doesn't exist in one of the strings, then return the substring without the current char.

class Solution(object):
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        """
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        minLen = min([len(a) for a in strs])

        for i in range(minLen):
            tmp = strs[0][i]
            for a in strs[1:]:
                if tmp != a[i]:
                    return strs[0][:i]

        return strs[0][:minLen]
